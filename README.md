# page-view-time-series-visualizer
 For this project I will visualize time series data using a line chart, bar chart, and box plots. I will use Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize a dataset containing the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03. The aim of this data visualizations is to help understand the patterns in visits and identify yearly and monthly growth.
